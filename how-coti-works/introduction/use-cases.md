# Use Cases



### 1. Confidential Transactions

Send and receive private tokens securely

Traditional blockchains expose every transaction and balance on-chain.\
With COTI V2, users can send and receive tokens privately, where transaction amounts, participants, and balances remain fully encrypted while preserving verifiability on the blockchain.

Secure tokenization becomes feasible, enabling the exchange of assets while protecting the confidentiality of transaction details.

### 2. Confidential DeFi

Privex: A Perpetual DEX with privacy built-in

DeFi transformed finance — but its radical transparency comes with risks.\
On-chain positions, liquidations, and strategies are visible to everyone, deterring institutional use and automated trading strategies.

COTI V2 enables confidential DeFi: all trades, positions, and settlement data remain encrypted while still verifiable. This ensures compliance readiness while safeguarding user privacy.

### 3. Private Voting

Confidential voting and governance

COTI’s privacy infrastructure powers secure, verifiable, and anonymous voting — ideal for DAOs, enterprises, or even public governance.\
Votes are cast privately, encrypted end-to-end, and tallied without exposing voter identities or individual choices.

Confidential voting systems maintain the integrity of elections by preserving the privacy of voters’ decisions.
