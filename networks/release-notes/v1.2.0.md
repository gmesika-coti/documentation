# v1.2.0

Release Notes v1.2.0\


Version **1.2.0** introduces the **Helium** protocol fork and major enhancements across both **MPC** and **gcEVM**, including improved arithmetic circuits, expanded bit-width support, and new debugging capabilities.\
The update focuses on extending computational expressiveness, improving correctness of arithmetic operations, and providing developers with better visibility into MPC execution.

## **Changes from v1.1.4**

#### **New Fork: Helium**

* Introduces updated arithmetic logic across MPC and gcEVM.
* Ensures network-wide alignment for expanded bit-width operations and improved circuit behavior.

### **MPC – Key Fixes & Improvements**

#### **Improved Circuits for Multiplication & Division**

1. Updated multiplication and division circuit implementations.
2. Improved correctness and performance based on refined internal circuit structures.
3. Adjusted MPC pricing parameters to reflect updated computation cost.

#### **Support for 128-bit and 256-bit MPC Operations**

4. MPC now supports securely computing 128-bit and 256-bit arithmetic.
5. Enables more complex and realistic workloads within private computation flows.

#### **Trace Debug Support for MPC Operations**

6. Introduces developer-facing trace/debug capabilities.
7. Allows inspection of circuit-level steps and intermediate values for debugging and validation.
8. Disabled by default, intended for development and testing.

### **gcEVM – Key Fixes & Improvements**

#### **Support for 128-bit and 256-bit Arithmetic**

1. Extended gcEVM instruction set and execution logic to handle 128-bit and 256-bit operations natively.
2. Ensures correct integration with updated MPC arithmetic circuits.
3. Enables private smart contracts to execute broader, more complex arithmetic functions.
